Let's think step by step on how to handle the missing values denoted by '?' in the CSV data:

1. **Load the Data**: First, we need to load the data into a suitable data structure. Since the data is in CSV format, we can use a data manipulation library like pandas in Python to load the data into a DataFrame. This will allow us to manipulate and analyze the data easily.

2. **Identify Missing Values**: After loading the data, we need to identify the missing values. In this dataset, missing values are represented by 'nan' (which pandas automatically recognizes as NaN - Not a Number). We need to ensure that all missing values are consistently represented as NaN for ease of processing.

3. **Analyze the Data**: Before deciding on the method to handle missing values, it's important to understand the context and significance of each column. For example, columns related to financial indicators might require different treatment compared to volume or price data.

4. **Decide on a Method to Handle Missing Values**: There are several methods to handle missing data:
   - **Deletion**: Remove rows with missing values. This is simple but can lead to loss of valuable data.
   - **Imputation**: Replace missing values with a substitute value. Common imputation techniques include:
     - Mean, median, or mode imputation.
     - Forward fill (propagate last valid observation forward).
     - Backward fill (use next valid observation to fill gap).
     - Predictive models (use regression, for instance, to estimate missing values).
   
5. **Implement the Chosen Method**: Apply the chosen method to handle missing values. For instance, if choosing imputation by mean, calculate the mean of each column and replace the NaNs with these mean values.

6. **Verify and Save the Cleaned Data**: After handling the missing values, it's important to verify that all missing values have been appropriately dealt with. Finally, the cleaned data can be saved back to a CSV file or used for further analysis.

Here's a simple example using Python and pandas to handle missing values by mean imputation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_file.csv')

# Replace 'nan' with NaN (if not already recognized)
data.replace('nan', np.nan, inplace=True)

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Impute missing values using mean
for column in data.columns:
    if data[column].dtype == float:  # Ensure we're only imputing numerical columns
        data[column].fillna(data[column].mean(), inplace=True)

# Verify no more missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Save cleaned data
data.to_csv('path_to_cleaned_file.csv', index=False)
```

This script loads the data, replaces any 'nan' strings with actual NaN values, imputes missing values using the mean of each column, and saves the cleaned data. Adjust the imputation method based on the specific needs and context of your dataset.
