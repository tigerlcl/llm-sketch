Let's think step by step about how to handle this missing value issue.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
We have a table with many columns and rows, where some values are denoted as '?' which means they are missing or not available.

**Step 2: Decide on an approach**
Before we dive into fixing the missing values, let's decide what kind of approach we want to take. Do we want to:
	* Fill in the missing values with a specific value (e.g., mean, median, mode)?
	* Replace the missing values with some sort of interpolation or imputation method?
	* Remove the rows with missing values altogether?

Let me know which direction you'd like to take!
