### Analysis of the Data

From the provided data, it appears that the column with missing values is the "Route" column. The missing value is denoted by '?'. To address this, we need to identify related columns that can help infer the missing "Route". The related columns are "Source" and "Destination" since the route is directly dependent on where the flight is coming from and going to.

### Related Columns
```json
["Source", "Destination", "Route"]
```

### Tuple Sampling
To create a rule for filling the missing "Route", we can sample records that have no issues in the "Route" column. Here are some samples:

```json
[
    ("Banglore", "Delhi", "BLR → HYD → DEL"),
    ("Banglore", "New Delhi", "BLR → BOM → DEL"),
    ("Mumbai", "Hyderabad", "BOM → HYD")
]
```

### Rule Mining
Based on the sampled data, we can observe a pattern that can be used to infer the missing route. Here's a potential rule:

```python
def infer_route(source, destination):
    if source == "Banglore" and destination in ["Delhi", "New Delhi"]:
        return "BLR → BOM → DEL"
    elif source == "Mumbai" and destination == "Hyderabad":
        return "BOM → HYD"
    else:
        return None  # Default case if no rule matches
```

This rule can be refined further with more data or domain knowledge.
