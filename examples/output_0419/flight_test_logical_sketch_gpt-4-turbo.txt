### Related Columns
The problematic column is "Route" and the related columns that can help fix the issue are "Source" and "Destination". Here they are together in an array:

```python
["Route", "Source", "Destination"]
```

### Tuple Sampling
To provide a sample of no-issue records based on the columns "Route", "Source", and "Destination", here is a random selection:

```python
[
    ("DEL → BOM → COK", "Delhi", "Cochin"),
    ("BOM → HYD", "Mumbai", "Hyderabad"),
    ("BLR → HYD → DEL", "Banglore", "New Delhi"),
    ("BOM → HYD", "Mumbai", "Hyderabad"),
    ("BLR → BOM → DEL", "Banglore", "New Delhi")
]
```

### Rule Mining
Based on the sampled results, the rule to determine the "Route" from "Source" and "Destination" can be inferred as follows:

```python
def infer_route(source, destination):
    if source == "Delhi" and destination == "Cochin":
        return "DEL → BOM → COK"
    elif source == "Mumbai" and destination == "Hyderabad":
        return "BOM → HYD"
    elif source == "Banglore" and destination == "New Delhi":
        return "BLR → BOM → DEL"
    elif source == "Banglore" and destination == "Delhi":
        return "BLR → DEL"
    else:
        return None
```

This function can be used to fill in the missing 'Route' values based on the 'Source' and 'Destination' columns.
