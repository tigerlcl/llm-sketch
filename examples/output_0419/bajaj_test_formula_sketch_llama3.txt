I'll go through each step for the missing values in the table.

**Missing Value 1: CCI5 (Row 7, Column 8)**

Step 1: Finding Missing value
The missing value is located at row 7, column 8. The entire row where the missing value is located is:

2015-02-03 14:15:00+05:30,418.54,419,417.94,418.43,7390,418.572,418.4348337,nan,1.54,-0.100248234,54.77489382

Step 2: Finding related Columns
The related columns are CCI5 (the column with the missing value), MOM10, and RSI8.

Step 3: Drafting Solution
We can use a simple imputation method like mean or median to fill in the missing value. Since there is only one missing value, we can calculate the average of the other values in the CCI5 column:

CCI5_mean = (418.214 + 418.544 + ... + 417.24) / 10
= 418.15

Step 4: Calculating Intermediate Values
No intermediate values are needed for this imputation.

Step 5: Calculating and Verifying the parameters
We don't need to calculate any parameters for this imputation, as we're using a simple mean or median method.

Step 6: Finding Related Rows
The related rows are all the rows in the CCI5 column that have values. We can use these values to calculate the average.

Step 7: Rebuild the Solution in code
Here's the Python code to impute the missing value:

```
cci5_mean = (418.214 + 418.544 + ... + 417.24) / 10
cci5_imputed = nan
cci5_imputed = cci5_mean
print(cci5_imputed)
```

**Missing Value 2: CCI5 (Row 9, Column 8)**

Step 1: Finding Missing value
The missing value is located at row 9, column 8. The entire row where the missing value is located is:

2015-02-03 14:55:00+05:30,418,418.78,418,418.02,26090,418.238,418.15,nan,0.49,-0.10, nan

Step 2: Finding related Columns
The related columns are CCI5 (the column with the missing value), MOM10, and RSI8.

Step 3: Drafting Solution
We can use a simple imputation method like mean or median to fill in the missing value. Since there is only one missing value, we can calculate the average of the other values in the CCI5 column:

CCI5_mean = (418.214 + 418.544 + ... + 417.24) / 10
= 418.15

```
cci5_mean = (418.214 + 418.544 + ... + 417.24) / 10
cci5_imputed = nan
 print(cci5_imputed)
