Let's think step by step to solve the missing value issue in the given dirty table:

1. Identify the type of data: The data provided is a tabular format with multiple columns and rows. We need to identify the type of data (e.g., numerical, categorical, etc.) for each column. In this case, we have date and time columns, which are numerical data types.
2. Check for missing values: Scan through the table to identify any missing values. In this case, there are two rows with missing values in the "Duration" column.
3. Determine the reason for missing values: Try to determine why some values are missing. In this case, it could be due to errors in data entry or incomplete data.
4. Choose a method to handle missing values: There are several methods to handle missing values, such as mean substitution, median substitution, or listwise deletion. We can choose the most appropriate method based on the context and the type of data. In this case, we will use listwise deletion since it is a numerical data type.
5. Implement the chosen method: Implement the chosen method to handle the missing values in the "Duration" column. For listwise deletion, we will replace the missing values with the value of the last non-missing observation in each group.
6. Check for outliers: After handling the missing values, check for any outliers or anomalies in the data. In this case, there are no obvious outliers or anomalies.
7. Preprocess the data (optional): Depending on the context and requirements of the analysis, we may need to preprocess the data further. For example, we could normalize or standardize the data, or transform categorical variables into numerical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
8. Analyze the data: Finally, we can analyze the cleaned and preprocessed data to answer the research question or solve the problem at hand.

By following these steps, we can handle the missing value issue in the given dirty table and obtain a clean and complete dataset for analysis.
