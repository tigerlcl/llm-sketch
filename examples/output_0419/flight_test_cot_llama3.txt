Let's think step by step!

The given dirty table has missing values denoted by the character '?'. The first row represents the header row. Our goal is to fill in these missing values.

Here are the steps we can follow:

1. **Understand the context**: Before attempting to fill in the missing values, let's take a closer look at the data and understand its context. What kind of information does this table represent? Is it related to airlines, travel, or something else?

2. **Identify the pattern (if any)**: Are there any patterns or relationships between the existing data and the missing values? For example, are there any specific dates or routes that might help us fill in the gaps?

3. **Determine the type of missing values**: Are the missing values random or does it follow a specific pattern? In this case, it seems like one of the columns has a missing value, which could be related to the travel route.

4. **Explore possible solutions**: Based on our understanding of the data and patterns (if any), we can explore different approaches to fill in the missing values:

   - Imputation methods: We could use statistical imputation methods like mean or median imputation, regression imputation, or k-nearest neighbors.
   
   - Data augmentation: If there are specific patterns or relationships between the existing data and the missing values, we might be able to augment the data by creating new rows with plausible values.

5. **Choose an approach**: Based on our analysis, let's choose a suitable approach to fill in the missing value. For this case, I think mean imputation would be a good starting point since it's a simple and straightforward method that can give us a quick estimate of the missing value.

6. **Implement the chosen approach**: We'll implement the chosen approach (in this case, mean imputation) using Python or another programming language to fill in the missing values.

7. **Evaluate and refine**: After filling in the missing values, we should evaluate the results to ensure they make sense and aren't introducing new biases. If necessary, we can refine our approach by incorporating additional insights from the data.

Let's get started with mean imputation for this problem!
