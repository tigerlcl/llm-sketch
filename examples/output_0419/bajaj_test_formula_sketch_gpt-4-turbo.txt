To address the missing values in the provided CSV data, we will follow the outlined steps for each missing value found in the dataset. Let's start by loading the data and identifying the missing values.

### Step 1: Finding Missing Value

First, we need to load the data and find the rows with missing values.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col=0)

# Display rows with missing values
missing_data_rows = data[data.isnull().any(axis=1)]
print(missing_data_rows)
```

### Missing Value: CCI5 on 2015-02-03 14:15:00+05:30

#### Step 2: Finding Related Columns
For the `CCI5` column, related columns might include `high`, `low`, `close`, and `open` since CCI (Commodity Channel Index) typically uses these values in its calculation.

```python
print("Related Columns: 'high', 'low', 'close', 'open'")
```

#### Step 3: Drafting Solution
The CCI is calculated using the formula involving the mean deviation and typical price (TP). We can impute the missing CCI value using the mean CCI of surrounding data points if the typical price does not deviate significantly.

```python
print("Solution: Impute missing CCI5 using the mean CCI5 of surrounding data points.")
```

#### Step 4: Calculating Intermediate Values
No intermediate values are needed beyond what is directly calculable from existing columns.

#### Step 5: Calculating and Verifying the Parameters
We will use three rows without missing CCI5 values to calculate the mean and verify this approach.

```python
# Select three sample rows without missing CCI5
sample_rows = data.dropna(subset=['CCI5']).sample(3)
print(sample_rows[['high', 'low', 'close', 'open', 'CCI5']])
```

#### Step 6: Finding Related Rows
We need the CCI5 values from the rows immediately before and after the missing value to calculate the mean.

```python
# Get the index of the missing CCI5 row
missing_index = data.index.get_loc('2015-02-03 14:15:00+05:30')

# Fetch surrounding rows' CCI5 values
related_cci5_values = data.iloc[[missing_index - 1, missing_index + 1]]['CCI5']
print(related_cci5_values)
```

#### Step 7: Rebuild the Solution in Code
Now, we will rebuild the solution to impute the missing CCI5 value using the mean of the surrounding values.

```python
# Calculate the mean CCI5 from surrounding values
mean_cci5 = related_cci5_values.mean()

# Impute the missing value
data.at['2015-02-03 14:15:00+05:30', 'CCI5'] = mean_cci5
print(f"Imputed CCI5 at 2015-02-03 14:15:00+05:30: {mean_cci5}")
```

This process should be repeated for each missing value in the dataset, following the same steps to ensure consistency and accuracy in data imputation.
