To fix the missing value denoted by '?' in tabular data, we need to identify the related columns that can help us fill this gap. Here are the related columns:

```array
['Airline', 'Date_of_Journey', 'Source', 'Destination', 'Route']
```

These columns are directly or indirectly related to the missing value in the 'Route' column.

Next, we need to randomly select no-issue records based on these related columns and show the result as an array of tuples:

```array
[
    ('Jet Airways', '6/06/2019', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BOM → COK', '18:15', '19:00 07 Jun', '24h 45m', '1 stop'),
    ('IndiGo', '24/06/2019', 'Mumbai', 'Hyderabad', 'BOM → HYD', '12:00', '13:30', '1h 30m', 'non-stop')
]
```

These records can be used as a base to infer the missing route.

Finally, we need to find out the rule which is expected to fit in sampled results. This rule can be derived by analyzing the patterns and relationships between the related columns:

```codeblock
if (Airline == 'IndiGo' && Date_of_Journey >= '3/05/2019') || 
   (Source == 'Banglore' && Destination == 'Delhi') then 
    Route = 'BLR → HYD → DEL'
```

This rule suggests that if the airline is IndiGo and the date of journey is after March 5, 2019, or if the source is Banglore and the destination is Delhi, then the route is likely to be BLR → HYD → DEL.
