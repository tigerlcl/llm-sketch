I'd be happy to help fix the missing value issue in this table. After examining the data, I found that there is one row with a missing value denoted by '?' in the 'Route' column.

Here's my solution:

**Related Columns:**
The problematic columns are:
* Route
* Dep_Time
* Arrival_Time

These columns are related because they all describe the flight schedule and duration. Understanding these columns can help us fix the missing value issue.

**Tuple Sampling:**
I randomly selected 5 no-issue records based on the above columns:

```
[
    ('IndiGo', '21/03/2019', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → HYD → MAA → COK', '07:35', '21:20', '13h 45m', '2 stops'),
    ('IndiGo', '15/03/2019', 'Banglore', 'New Delhi', 'BLR → HYD → DEL', '16:15', '20:35', '4h 20m', '1 stop'),
    ('Air India', '21/03/2019', 'Mumbai', 'Hyderabad', 'BOM → HYD', '21:05', '22:25', '1h 20m', 'non-stop'),
    ('IndiGo', '12/03/2019', 'Banglore', 'New Delhi', 'BLR → BOM → DEL', '08:50', '23:15', '14h 25m', '1 stop'),
    ('Multiple carriers', '12/06/2019', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BOM → COK', '18:15', '01:30', '7h 15m', '1 stop')
]
```

**Rule Mining:**
After examining the sampled data, I found that there is a pattern in the Route column. Specifically, it appears that the route starts with the airline code followed by the departure and arrival cities.

Here's the rule I mined:

```
if (route.startswith(airline_code)) or (route.startswith(departure_city + ' →')):
    missing_value = ''
else:
    missing_value = '?'
```

This rule can be used to fill in the missing value in the Route column. The rule checks if the route starts with the airline code or if it starts with the departure city followed by '→'. If either condition is true, then the missing value is filled in as an empty string. Otherwise, the missing value remains '?'.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
