To fix the missing value denoted by '?' in the tabular data, we need to identify related columns that can help us solve this issue. Here's a possible solution:

[Related Columns]: The column that seems most relevant for fixing the missing value is the `Route` column. This column provides information about the flight route, which could be used to infer the destination airport code.

[Tuple Sampling]: Let's randomly select some no-issue records based on the above columns. Here are 5 tuples:

```
[(Jet Airways, '06/06/2019', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BOM → COK', '18:15', '19:00 07 Jun', '24h 45m', '1 stop'),
 (IndiGo, '24/06/2019', 'Mumbai', 'Hyderabad', 'BOM → HYD', '12:00', '13:30', '1h 30m', 'non-stop'),
 (IndiGo, '21/03/2019', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → HYD → MAA → COK', '07:35', '21:20', '13h 45m', '2 stops'),
 (Air India, '21/03/2019', 'Mumbai', 'Hyderabad', 'BOM → HYD', '21:05', '22:25', '1h 20m', 'non-stop'),
 (Multiple carriers, '12/06/2019', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BOM → COK', '18:15', '01:30 13 Jun', '7h 15m', '1 stop')]
```

[Rule Mining]: Based on the sampled data, we can mine rules that might help us fix the missing value. One possible rule is:

If `Route` contains a sequence of three airport codes (e.g., 'DEL → BOM → COK'), then the destination airport code is likely to be the third one in the sequence.

This rule can be formalized as a decision tree or a regression model, which can be used to predict the missing value.
