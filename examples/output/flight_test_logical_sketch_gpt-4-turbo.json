    "content": "To address the missing value issue in the provided CSV data, we first need to identify any columns that contain the missing value denoted by '?'. Since the data provided in the example does not explicitly show any '?', we will assume a scenario where such missing values could exist and demonstrate how to handle them.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Problematic Columns\nLet's assume that the missing value '?' appears in the 'Route' and 'Total_Stops' columns. These columns are crucial for understanding the flight path and the number of stops a flight makes.\n\n[Related Columns]: `['Source', 'Destination', 'Route', 'Total_Stops']`\n\n### Step 2: Tuple Sampling\nTo create a rule for filling missing values, we need to sample some records that do not have issues (i.e., they do not contain '?'). We will randomly select a few records to understand the typical values based on 'Source' and 'Destination'.\n\nAssuming the data is loaded into a DataFrame named `df`, we can use the following code to sample records:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example DataFrame loading (assuming the data is in a CSV file named 'data.csv')\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Filter out rows where 'Route' or 'Total_Stops' might be missing\nclean_df = df[df['Route'].notna() & df['Total_Stops'].notna()]\n\n# Randomly sample 3 records for analysis\nsampled_records = clean_df.sample(3)\nprint(sampled_records[['Source', 'Destination', 'Route', 'Total_Stops']])\n```\n\n### Step 3: Rule Mining\nFrom the sampled data, we can derive a rule. For instance, if we notice that all flights from 'Banglore' to 'Delhi' have a specific route and number of stops, we can generalize this observation.\n\nAssuming the sampled data shows:\n- All flights from 'Banglore' to 'Delhi' are 'BLR \u2192 DEL' and 'non-stop'.\n\nWe can create a rule:\n```python\ndef fill_missing_values(row):\n    if pd.isna(row['Route']) or pd.isna(row['Total_Stops']):\n        if row['Source'] == 'Banglore' and row['Destination'] == 'Delhi':\n            row['Route'] = 'BLR \u2192 DEL'\n            row['Total_Stops'] = 'non-stop'\n    return row\n\n# Apply the rule to the DataFrame\ndf = df.apply(fill_missing_values, axis=1)\n```\n\nThis rule checks if there are missing values in 'Route' or 'Total_Stops', and if the flight is from 'Banglore' to 'Delhi', it fills in the missing values with 'BLR \u2192 DEL' for 'Route' and 'non-stop' for 'Total_Stops'.\n\nThis approach provides a systematic way to handle missing values based on observed patterns in the data."
