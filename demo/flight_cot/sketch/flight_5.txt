Let's think step by step about how to identify and address the missing value in the provided dataset. The dataset consists of columns such as Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time, Duration, and Total_Stops. Each row represents a flight record.

1. **Identify the Missing Value**: We need to scan through each column of each row to find where the '?' appears. From the provided data, it is clear that the missing value '?' is in the 'Route' column of the last row.

2. **Understanding the Context**: The missing 'Route' value is for a flight from Kolkata to Bangalore on Jet Airways. The departure time is not provided, but the arrival time is '19:50 25 May', which suggests an overnight flight.

3. **Inferring the Missing Value**: To infer the missing 'Route', we can look at other flights in the dataset from Kolkata to Bangalore on Jet Airways. There is another Jet Airways flight in the dataset from Kolkata to Bangalore with the route 'CCU → DEL → BLR'. Given that the flight with the missing route also has a long duration (23h 50m) and includes one stop, it is reasonable to assume it might follow a similar multi-city route.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most likely missing route for the flight is similar to the other Jet Airways flight from Kolkata to Bangalore, which is 'CCU → DEL → BLR'.

Thus, the missing value is ##CCU → DEL → BLR##.
