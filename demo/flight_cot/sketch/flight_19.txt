Let's think step by step about how to address the missing value in the 'Duration' column for the first row of the data provided.

1. **Identify the Missing Value**: The missing value is in the 'Duration' column for the first row where the airline is "Multiple carriers".

2. **Understand the Data**: The 'Duration' column represents the total time taken for the flight from the 'Source' to the 'Destination', including any stops.

3. **Analyze Related Data**: We can calculate the duration by subtracting the 'Dep_Time' from the 'Arrival_Time'. However, since the 'Arrival_Time' is on the same day as the 'Dep_Time' for the row with the missing value, we can directly calculate it.

4. **Calculate the Duration**:
   - Departure Time (Dep_Time): 07:30
   - Arrival Time (Arrival_Time): 19:00
   - Convert both times into minutes from midnight:
     - Dep_Time: 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 450 minutes
     - Arrival_Time: 19 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1140 minutes
   - Duration in minutes: 1140 minutes - 450 minutes = 690 minutes
   - Convert minutes back into hours and minutes:
     - Hours: 690 minutes / 60 = 11 hours
     - Minutes: 690 minutes % 60 = 30 minutes
   - Therefore, the duration is 11 hours and 30 minutes.

5. **Present the Result**: The missing value for the duration of the flight from Delhi to Cochin for "Multiple carriers" is 11 hours and 30 minutes.

Thus, the missing value is ##11h 30m##.
