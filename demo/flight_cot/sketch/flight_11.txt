Let's think step by step about how to address the missing value in the dataset provided. The missing value is denoted by '?' in the 'Duration' column for the SpiceJet flight on 9/04/2019 from Delhi to Cochin.

1. **Identify the Missing Value**: The missing value is in the 'Duration' column for the SpiceJet flight.

2. **Understand the Data**: The 'Duration' column represents the total time taken for the flight from the 'Dep_Time' to the 'Arrival_Time'.

3. **Calculate the Duration**: For the SpiceJet flight, the departure time ('Dep_Time') is 06:05 and the arrival time ('Arrival_Time') is 11:20 on the same day.

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Convert the times into a format that can be subtracted (e.g., minutes since midnight).
   - Dep_Time: 06:05 AM → 365 minutes after midnight.
   - Arrival_Time: 11:20 AM → 680 minutes after midnight.
   - Duration in minutes = 680 - 365 = 315 minutes.

5. **Convert Duration Back to Hours and Minutes**:
   - Hours = 315 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.
   - Remaining Minutes = 315 minutes % 60 = 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the duration is 5 hours and 15 minutes.

The missing value is ##5h 15m##.
