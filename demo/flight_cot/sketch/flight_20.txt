Let's think step by step about how to address the missing value in the 'Total_Stops' column for the first row of your data.

1. **Understanding the Data**: The column 'Total_Stops' indicates the number of stops between the source and the destination. This is crucial for understanding the journey's complexity and duration.

2. **Analyzing the Route**: For the first row, the route is 'BLR → BOM → DEL'. This indicates that the flight goes from Bangalore (BLR) to Mumbai (BOM) and then from Mumbai to Delhi (DEL).

3. **Counting the Stops**: Based on the route provided, there are two segments in the journey:
   - Bangalore to Mumbai
   - Mumbai to Delhi
   This implies there is one stopover at Mumbai.

4. **Conclusion**: Since there is one stop at Mumbai, the missing value in the 'Total_Stops' column for the first row should be '1 stop'.

Therefore, the missing value is ##1 stop##.
