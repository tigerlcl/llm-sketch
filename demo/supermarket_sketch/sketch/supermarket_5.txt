### Related Columns

To address the missing value in the 'Total' column, we can utilize the following columns that are related and can help compute or verify the missing value:

```python
related_columns = ["Unit price", "Quantity", "Tax 5%", "Total", "Costs of goods sold", "Gross income"]
```

### Tuple Sampling

We will randomly select several records that do not have issues (i.e., no missing values in the 'Total' column) to understand the relationship between these columns. Here are three sampled records:

```python
sampled_records = [
    ("47.65", "3", "7.1475", "150.0975", "142.95", "6.8616"),
    ("42.08", "6", "12.624", "265.104", "252.48", "12.11904"),
    ("98.97", "9", "44.5365", "935.2665", "890.73", "42.75504")
]
```

### Rule Mining

From the sampled records, we can derive a rule to calculate the 'Total' when it is missing. The 'Total' can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5%} \]

Here is the Python code to implement this rule:

```python
def calculate_total(unit_price, quantity, tax_5):
    return (unit_price * quantity) + tax_5

# Example usage:
unit_price = 46.22
quantity = 4
tax_5 = 9.244
total = calculate_total(unit_price, quantity, tax_5)
print(f"Calculated Total: {total}")
```

This rule should help in fixing the missing 'Total' value in the dataset.
