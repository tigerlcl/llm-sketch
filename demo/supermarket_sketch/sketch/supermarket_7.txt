### Step 1: Locate the Problematic and Related Columns

From the provided data, it's clear that the 'Total' column has a missing value denoted by '?'. To address this, we need to identify columns that are related to 'Total' to help compute or infer the missing value.

**Problematic Column**: 'Total'

**Related Columns**: 'Unit price', 'Quantity', 'Tax 5%', 'Costs of goods sold'

All these columns are directly related to the calculation of 'Total'. The array of these columns would be:

```python
['Total', 'Unit price', 'Quantity', 'Tax 5%', 'Costs of goods sold']
```

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

We will randomly select several records that do not have issues in the 'Total' column to understand the relationship between these columns. Here are three sampled records:

```python
[
    ('254.016', '34.56', '7', '12.096', '241.92'),
    ('177.408', '21.12', '8', '8.448', '168.96'),
    ('446.964', '53.21', '8', '21.284', '425.68')
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

From the sampled data, we can observe a pattern or rule that can be used to compute the 'Total' when it's missing. The 'Total' is calculated as the sum of 'Tax 5%' and 'Costs of goods sold'. This can be represented in Python as follows:

```python
def calculate_total(tax_5, costs_of_goods_sold):
    return tax_5 + costs_of_goods_sold
```

Using this function, we can compute the missing 'Total' value for the problematic record:

```python
missing_total = calculate_total(4.5555, 91.11)
print("Calculated Total for missing value:", missing_total)
```

This approach provides a systematic way to handle missing values in the 'Total' column based on related financial data.
