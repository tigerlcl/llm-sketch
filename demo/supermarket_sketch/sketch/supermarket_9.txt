### Step 1: Related Columns

To address the missing value in the 'Total' column, we need to identify the columns that are directly related to it. Based on the data provided, the 'Total' column can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

Thus, the related columns are:
- Unit price
- Quantity
- Tax 5%

Here are the columns together in an array:

```python
related_columns = ['Unit price', 'Quantity', 'Tax 5%', 'Total']
```

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

We will randomly select several records that do not have issues (i.e., records where 'Total' is not missing) to understand the relationship between these columns. Here are three sampled records:

```python
sampled_records = [
    (99.69, 1, 4.9845, 104.6745),
    (55.87, 10, 27.935, 586.635),
    (12.12, 10, 6.06, 127.26)
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

From the sampled records, we can derive the rule for calculating the 'Total' value when it is missing. The Python code to calculate 'Total' based on the related columns is:

```python
def calculate_total(unit_price, quantity, tax):
    return (unit_price * quantity) + tax
```

This function can be used to fill in the missing 'Total' values in the dataset. For instance, for the record with missing 'Total':

```python
missing_total = calculate_total(43.25, 2, 4.325)
print(missing_total)  # Output should be the calculated total for the missing record
```

This approach ensures that all missing 'Total' values are accurately computed based on the existing data in the related columns.
