### Step 1: Related Columns

From the provided data, it appears that the missing value is in the "Gross income" column. To determine the related columns that can help fix this issue, we need to understand how "Gross income" is calculated. Based on the data, "Gross income" seems to be related to "Total" and "Costs of goods sold".

The related columns are:
```python
["Total", "Costs of goods sold", "Gross income"]
```

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

To sample no-issue records for the related columns, we will select records where "Gross income" is not missing. Here are a few sampled records:

```python
sampled_records = [
    (836.304, 796.48, 38.23104),
    (451.71, 430.2, 20.6496),
    (190.4805, 181.41, 8.70768),
    (167.034, 159.08, 7.63584)
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

From the sampled records, we can observe a pattern or rule to calculate "Gross income". It seems that "Gross income" is the difference between "Total" and "Costs of goods sold". We can express this relationship with the following Python code:

```python
def calculate_gross_income(total, costs_of_goods_sold):
    return total - costs_of_goods_sold
```

Using this function, we can fix the missing value in the "Gross income" column for the problematic record:

```python
# Problematic record details
total = 16.275
costs_of_goods_sold = 15.5

# Calculate missing Gross income
gross_income = calculate_gross_income(total, costs_of_goods_sold)
print("Calculated Gross Income:", gross_income)
```

This approach should correctly fill in the missing value for "Gross income" in the dataset.
