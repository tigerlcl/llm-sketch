To address this, we need to identify columns that are related to 'Total' to help compute or infer the missing value.\n\n**Problematic Column**: 'Total'\n\n**Related Columns**: 'Unit price', 'Quantity', 'Tax 5%', 'Costs of goods sold'\n\nAll these columns are directly related to the calculation of 'Total'. The array of these columns would be:\n\n```python\n['Total', 'Unit price', 'Quantity', 'Tax 5%', 'Costs of goods sold']\n```\n\n### Step 2: Tuple Sampling\n\nWe will randomly select several records that do not have issues in the 'Total' column to understand the relationship between these columns. Here are three sampled records:\n\n```python\n[\n    ('254.016', '34.56', '7', '12.096', '241.92'),\n    ('177.408', '21.12', '8', '8.448', '168.96'),\n    ('446.964', '53.21', '8', '21.284', '425.68')\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Rule Mining\n\nFrom the sampled data, we can observe a pattern or rule that can be used to compute the 'Total' when it's missing. The 'Total' is calculated as the sum of 'Tax 5%' and 'Costs of goods sold'. This can be represented in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total(tax_5, costs_of_goods_sold):\n    return tax_5 + costs_of_goods_sold\n```\n\nUsing this function, we can compute the missing 'Total' value for the problematic record:\n\n```python\nmissing_total = calculate_total(4.5555, 91.11)\nprint(\"Calculated Total for missing value:\", missing_total)\n```\n\nThis approach provides a systematic way to handle missing values in the 'Total' column based on related financial data.\n            ",
