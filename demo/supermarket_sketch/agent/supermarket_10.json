Here are a few sampled records:\n\n```python\n[\n    (51.71, 4, 10.342, 217.182, 206.84, 4.8, 9.92832),\n    (67.26, 4, 13.452, 282.492, 269.04, 4.8, 12.91392),\n    (58.75, 6, 17.625, 370.125, 352.5, 4.8, 16.92),\n    (57.74, 3, 8.661, 181.881, 173.22, 4.8, 8.31456)\n]\n```\n\n### Rule Mining\nFrom the sampled data, we can observe a pattern or rule to calculate the \"Gross income\". The \"Gross income\" seems to be calculated as the difference between \"Total\" and \"Costs of goods sold\". Here is the Python code to calculate \"Gross income\":\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gross_income(total, costs_of_goods_sold):\n    return total - costs_of_goods_sold\n```\n\nUsing this function, we can fix the missing value in the \"Gross income\" column for the problematic record:\n\n```python\n# Problematic record details\ntotal = 127.26\ncosts_of_goods_sold = 121.2\n\n# Calculate missing Gross income\nmissing_gross_income = calculate_gross_income(total, costs_of_goods_sold)\nprint(\"Calculated Gross Income:\", missing_gross_income)\n```\n\nThis approach should correctly fill in the missing value for \"Gross income\" based on the observed rule from the sampled data.\n            ",
