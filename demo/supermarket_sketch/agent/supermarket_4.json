To determine the related columns that can help fix this issue, we need to understand how \"Gross income\" is calculated. Based on the data, \"Gross income\" seems to be related to \"Total\" and \"Costs of goods sold\".\n\nThe related columns are:\n```python\n[\"Total\", \"Costs of goods sold\", \"Gross income\"]\n```\n\n### Step 2: Tuple Sampling\n\nTo sample no-issue records for the related columns, we will select records where \"Gross income\" is not missing. Here are a few sampled records:\n\n```python\nsampled_records = [\n    (836.304, 796.48, 38.23104),\n    (451.71, 430.2, 20.6496),\n    (190.4805, 181.41, 8.70768),\n    (167.034, 159.08, 7.63584)\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Rule Mining\n\nFrom the sampled records, we can observe a pattern or rule to calculate \"Gross income\". It seems that \"Gross income\" is the difference between \"Total\" and \"Costs of goods sold\". We can express this relationship with the following Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gross_income(total, costs_of_goods_sold):\n    return total - costs_of_goods_sold\n```\n\nUsing this function, we can fix the missing value in the \"Gross income\" column for the problematic record:\n\n```python\n# Problematic record details\ntotal = 16.275\ncosts_of_goods_sold = 15.5\n\n# Calculate missing Gross income\ngross_income = calculate_gross_income(total, costs_of_goods_sold)\nprint(\"Calculated Gross Income:\", gross_income)\n```\n\nThis approach should correctly fill in the missing value for \"Gross income\" in the dataset.\n            ",
