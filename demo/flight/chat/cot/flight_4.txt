Let's think step by step about how to identify and fix the missing value in the provided dataset.

1. **Identify the Missing Value**: We need to check each column for any missing or incomplete data. By examining the data, we can see that the last column, "Total_Stops," is missing for the entry:
   - Multiple carriers, 15/05/2019, Delhi, Cochin, DEL → BOM → COK, 11:30, 19:15, 7h 45m,

2. **Analyze the Route**: The route for this entry is "DEL → BOM → COK," which indicates that the flight has one stopover (at BOM).

3. **Determine the Correct Value**: Since the route involves one stop, the correct value for "Total_Stops" should be "1 stop."

4. **Present the Answer**: Based on the analysis, the missing value in the dataset is for the "Total_Stops" column where the route is "DEL → BOM → COK." The correct value should be "1 stop."

Thus, the missing value is ##1 stop##.
