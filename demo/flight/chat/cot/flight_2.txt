Let's think step by step about how to identify and fix the missing value in the dataset provided.

1. **Identify the Missing Value**: By examining the dataset, we can see that each row should have values for the following columns: Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time, Duration, and Total_Stops. The row with missing data can be identified by checking each column for completeness.

2. **Locate the Row with Missing Data**: By looking through each row, we find that the row:
   ```
   Jet Airways,12/05/2019,Kolkata,Banglore,CCU → BOM → BLR,16:30,04:40 13 May,12h 10m,
   ```
   is missing a value in the `Total_Stops` column.

3. **Determine the Correct Value for the Missing Data**: Since the route is "CCU → BOM → BLR", it implies there is one stop at BOM (Mumbai). Therefore, the missing value should be "1 stop".

4. **Provide the Answer**: With the missing value identified and the correct value determined, we can now format the result as required.

The missing value is ##1 stop##.
