### Issue Targeting
Upon reviewing the dataset, it's clear that there is a missing value in the "Source" column for the first entry (Air India).

### Columns Filtering
To address the missing "Source" value, we can use the "Route" column, which provides the sequence of airports used for the journey. This column can help determine the starting airport, which corresponds to the "Source".

### Entry Sampling
Let's sample a few entries with no issues in the "Source" and "Route" columns to understand how the "Source" relates to the "Route":

1. Jet Airways, 18/05/2019, Kolkata, Banglore, CCU → DEL → BLR, 09:35, 09:45 19 May, 24h 10m, 1 stop
2. Multiple carriers, 27/05/2019, Delhi, Cochin, DEL → BOM → COK, 11:40, 21:00, 9h 20m, 1 stop
3. IndiGo, 24/03/2019, Banglore, New Delhi, BLR → DEL, 04:00, 06:50, 2h 50m, non-stop

### Rule Mining
From the samples, it's evident that the first airport code in the "Route" column corresponds to the "Source" city's airport code:
- CCU corresponds to Kolkata
- DEL corresponds to Delhi
- BLR corresponds to Banglore

### Rule Formulation
We can formulate a function that extracts the first airport code from the "Route" and maps it to the city name to fill in the missing "Source" value.

```python
def impute_missing_source(route):
    # Mapping of airport codes to city names
    airport_to_city = {
        'DEL': 'Delhi',
        'CCU': 'Kolkata',
        'BLR': 'Banglore',
        'BOM': 'Mumbai',
        'GOI': 'Goa',
        'COK': 'Cochin',
        'JAI': 'Jaipur'
    }
    
    # Extract the first airport code from the route
    first_airport_code = route.split(' → ')[0]
    
    # Return the corresponding city name
    return airport_to_city.get(first_airport_code, "Unknown")

# Example usage for the missing value in the dataset
missing_source_route = "DEL → GOI → BOM → COK"
imputed_source = impute_missing_source(missing_source_route)
print(f"The imputed source for the route '{missing_source_route}' is {imputed_source}.")
```

This function will correctly fill the missing "Source" value for the Air India entry based on the provided "Route".
