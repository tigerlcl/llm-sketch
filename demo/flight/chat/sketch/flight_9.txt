### Issue Targeting:
Upon scanning the data, the missing value issue is identified in the `Source` column for the second entry (IndiGo, 21/03/2019).

### Columns Filtering:
To fix the issue, the `Source` column is directly affected. Additionally, the `Route` column can help deduce the missing `Source` as it indicates the starting point of the journey.

### Entry Sampling:
Let's sample a few entries with no issues in the `Source` and `Route` columns:
1. Jet Airways, 9/05/2019, Banglore, Delhi, BLR → DEL
2. Jet Airways, 01/03/2019, Banglore, New Delhi, BLR → BOM → DEL
3. Jet Airways, 21/03/2019, Delhi, Cochin, DEL → BOM → COK
4. IndiGo, 6/05/2019, Kolkata, Banglore, CCU → HYD → BLR

### Rule Mining:
From the sampled entries, we observe that the first airport code in the `Route` column corresponds to the `Source` city:
- BLR corresponds to Banglore
- DEL corresponds to Delhi
- CCU corresponds to Kolkata

### Rule Formulation:
Using the rule mined from the samples, we can formulate a function to extract the source city from the `Route` column when the `Source` is missing.

```python
def impute_missing_source(route):
    # Extract the first airport code from the route
    first_airport = route.split(" → ")[0]
    
    # Mapping of airport codes to city names
    airport_to_city = {
        "BLR": "Banglore",
        "DEL": "Delhi",
        "CCU": "Kolkata",
        "BOM": "Mumbai"  # Added for completeness, though not used in this specific case
    }
    
    # Return the corresponding city name
    return airport_to_city.get(first_airport, "Unknown")  # Default to "Unknown" if not found

# Example usage:
missing_source_route = "DEL → BOM → COK"
imputed_source = impute_missing_source(missing_source_route)
print("Imputed Source:", imputed_source)
```

This function will correctly impute the missing `Source` value for the entry with the route "DEL → BOM → COK" by mapping "DEL" to "Delhi".
