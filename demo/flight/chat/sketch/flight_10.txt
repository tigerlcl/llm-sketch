### Issue Targeting
Upon reviewing the data, it's evident that there is a missing value in the `Total_Stops` column for one of the entries (GoAir, 1/06/2019, Delhi to Cochin).

### Columns Filtering
To address this issue, we will focus on the following columns:
- `Route`: To understand the number of stops based on the route taken.
- `Total_Stops`: To determine the number of stops for other entries with similar routes.

### Entry Sampling
Let's sample entries with similar routes to understand the relationship between `Route` and `Total_Stops`:
- Multiple carriers, 6/03/2019, Delhi to Cochin, DEL → BOM → COK, 1 stop
- Multiple carriers, 15/06/2019, Delhi to Cochin, DEL → IXU → BOM → COK, 2 stops
- GoAir, 1/06/2019, Delhi to Cochin, DEL → BOM → COK, (missing)

### Rule Mining
From the sampled entries, we observe:
- Route "DEL → BOM → COK" corresponds to "1 stop".
- Adding an intermediate stop (like IXU) increases the count by one.

### Rule Formulation
Based on the observed pattern, we can formulate a rule to impute the missing value for the GoAir flight on 1/06/2019:
- If the route is "DEL → BOM → COK", then `Total_Stops` should be "1 stop".

Here's the function to implement this rule:

```python
def impute_missing_stops(route):
    if route == "DEL → BOM → COK":
        return "1 stop"
    else:
        return None  # This function can be expanded for other routes if needed

# Applying the function to the specific missing entry
missing_route = "DEL → BOM → COK"
imputed_stops = impute_missing_stops(missing_route)
print(f"The imputed number of stops for the route '{missing_route}' is: {imputed_stops}")
```

This function checks the route and assigns the number of stops accordingly. In this case, it correctly assigns "1 stop" to the GoAir flight on 1/06/2019 from Delhi to Cochin with the route "DEL → BOM → COK".
