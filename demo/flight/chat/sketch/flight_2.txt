### Step-by-Step Solution to Fix the Missing Value in the Dataset

#### [Issue Targeting]
Upon examining the dataset, it's clear that there is a missing value in the `Total_Stops` column for one of the entries:
- Jet Airways, 12/05/2019, Kolkata, Banglore, CCU → BOM → BLR, 16:30, 04:40 13 May, 12h 10m

#### [Columns Filtering]
To address this issue, we'll focus on the `Route` and `Total_Stops` columns. The `Route` column provides a direct indication of how many stops are made, which correlates to the `Total_Stops` field.

#### [Entry Sampling]
Let's sample a few entries with no issues in the `Route` and `Total_Stops` columns:
1. Jet Airways, 24/03/2019, Kolkata, Banglore, CCU → BOM → BLR, 13:55, 19:40, 5h 45m, 1 stop
2. Jet Airways, 12/05/2019, Kolkata, Banglore, CCU → BOM → BLR, 08:25, 09:20 13 May, 24h 55m, 1 stop
3. Jet Airways, 9/06/2019, Delhi, Cochin, DEL → BOM → COK, 09:00, 19:00, 10h, 1 stop

#### [Rule Mining]
From the sampled entries, it's evident that the number of arrows (`→`) minus one in the `Route` column corresponds to the number of stops:
- CCU → BOM → BLR has 2 arrows and is labeled as "1 stop".
- DEL → BOM → COK also has 2 arrows and is labeled as "1 stop".

#### [Rule Formulation]
We can now formulate a rule to compute the missing `Total_Stops` based on the `Route` information:

```python
def impute_total_stops(route):
    # Count the number of segments in the route (subtract 1 from the count of '→')
    stops_count = route.count('→') - 1
    # Map the number of stops to the corresponding label
    if stops_count == 0:
        return 'non-stop'
    elif stops_count == 1:
        return '1 stop'
    elif stops_count == 2:
        return '2 stops'
    else:
        return f'{stops_count} stops'

# Example usage:
missing_value_route = "CCU → BOM → BLR"
imputed_total_stops = impute_total_stops(missing_value_route)
print("Imputed Total Stops:", imputed_total_stops)
```

This function will correctly impute the missing `Total_Stops` value based on the pattern observed in the `Route` column.
