### Step 1: Issue Targeting
Upon scanning the data, it's evident that there is a missing value in the "Source" column for one of the entries (Jet Airways, 6/06/2019).

### Step 2: Columns Filtering
To address the missing "Source" value, we can use the "Route" column which provides a detailed path of the journey. The "Route" column can help us deduce the missing "Source".

### Step 3: Entry Sampling
Let's randomly select a few entries that have no issues in the "Source" and "Route" columns:
- Air India, 21/03/2019, Delhi, Cochin, DEL → CCU → BOM → COK, 06:50, 19:15 22 Mar, 36h 25m, 2 stops
- IndiGo, 24/03/2019, Banglore, New Delhi, BLR → DEL, 06:00, 08:45, 2h 45m, non-stop
- Jet Airways, 15/06/2019, Delhi, Cochin, DEL → JAI → BOM → COK, 09:40, 19:00, 9h 20m, 2 stops

### Step 4: Rule Mining
From the sampled entries, we observe that the first part of the "Route" (before the first arrow) corresponds to the "Source". For example:
- "DEL → CCU → BOM → COK" corresponds to "Source" being Delhi.
- "BLR → DEL" corresponds to "Source" being Banglore.
- "DEL → JAI → BOM → COK" corresponds to "Source" being Delhi.

### Step 5: Rule Formulation
We can create a function that extracts the source from the "Route" by splitting the string and taking the first part before the arrow.

```python
def impute_missing_source(route):
    if route:
        return route.split(" → ")[0]
    return None

# Applying the function to the missing entry
missing_route = "DEL → NAG → BOM → COK"
imputed_source = impute_missing_source(missing_route)
print("Imputed Source:", imputed_source)
```

This function splits the "Route" at " → " and takes the first element of the resulting list, which corresponds to the source airport code. This code can be mapped to the city name if necessary, but in this context, we directly use the airport code as the city name.
