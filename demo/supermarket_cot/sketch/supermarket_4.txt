Let's think step by step about how to handle the missing value in the 'Gross income' column for the 'Fashion accessories' product line.

1. **Understanding the Data**: The 'Gross income' is calculated as a percentage of the 'Costs of goods sold'. The formula given in the data is:
   \[
   \text{Gross income} = \left(\frac{\text{Gross margin percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Costs of goods sold}
   \]
   From the data, the 'Gross margin percentage' is consistently 4.8 for all entries.

2. **Identify the Missing Value**: The missing value is in the 'Gross income' column for the 'Fashion accessories' product line where the 'Costs of goods sold' is 15.5.

3. **Calculate the Missing Value**:
   \[
   \text{Gross income} = \left(\frac{4.8}{100}\right) \times 15.5 = 0.744
   \]

4. **Present the Answer**: The missing value in the 'Gross income' column for the 'Fashion accessories' product line is 0.744.

Therefore, the missing value is ##0.744##.
