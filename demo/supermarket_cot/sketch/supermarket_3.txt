Let's think step by step about how to handle the missing value in the dataset provided. The missing value is in the 'Total' column for the row with Invoice ID '325-90-8763'. To calculate the 'Total', we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data:
- Unit price = 46.57
- Quantity = 10
- Tax 5% = 23.285

Plugging these values into the formula gives:
\[ \text{Total} = (46.57 \times 10) + 23.285 = 465.7 + 23.285 = 488.985 \]

Thus, the missing value is the total cost for the invoice ID '325-90-8763'. Formatting the result as specified:

the missing value is ##488.985##
