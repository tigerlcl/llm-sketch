Let's think step by step about how to handle the missing value in the 'Gross income' column for the second row of your data. The formula to calculate 'Gross income' is typically derived from the 'Total' and 'Costs of goods sold' (COGS) as follows:

\[ \text{Gross income} = \text{Total} - \text{Costs of goods sold} \]

From the data provided:
- Total for the second row = 232.155
- Costs of goods sold for the second row = 221.1

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Gross income} = 232.155 - 221.1 = 11.055 \]

Thus, the missing value in the 'Gross income' column for the second row is 11.055. Therefore, the formatted result is: the missing value is ##11.055##.
