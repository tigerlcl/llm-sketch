Let's think step by step about how to handle the missing value in the 'Gross income' column for the 'Home and lifestyle' product line.

1. **Understanding the Data**: The 'Gross income' is calculated as a percentage of the 'Costs of goods sold'. The formula used here seems to be:
   \[
   \text{Gross income} = \text{Costs of goods sold} \times \left(\frac{\text{Gross margin percentage}}{100}\right)
   \]

2. **Identify the Known Values**: For the 'Home and lifestyle' product line with the missing 'Gross income', the 'Costs of goods sold' is 121.2 and the 'Gross margin percentage' is 4.8.

3. **Apply the Formula**:
   \[
   \text{Gross income} = 121.2 \times \left(\frac{4.8}{100}\right) = 121.2 \times 0.048 = 5.8176
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The missing 'Gross income' value for the 'Home and lifestyle' product line is 5.8176.

Therefore, the missing value is ##5.8176##.
