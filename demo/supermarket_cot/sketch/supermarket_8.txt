Let's think step by step about how to handle the missing value in the 'Gross income' column for the row with Invoice ID '142-63-6033'. 

1. **Understanding the Data**: The 'Gross income' is calculated as a percentage of the 'Costs of goods sold'. The formula used here seems to be:
   \[
   \text{Gross income} = \left(\frac{\text{Gross margin percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Costs of goods sold}
   \]
   Given that the 'Gross margin percentage' is consistently 4.8 across all entries.

2. **Identifying the Missing Value**: The missing value is in the 'Gross income' column for the row where 'Costs of goods sold' is 461.8.

3. **Calculating the Missing Value**:
   \[
   \text{Gross income} = \left(\frac{4.8}{100}\right) \times 461.8 = 0.048 \times 461.8 = 22.1664
   \]

Thus, the missing value is ##22.1664##.
