To find the missing value for the 'Gross income' in the first row of the data, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Gross income} = \text{Total} - \text{Costs of goods sold} \]

From the data provided:
- Total for the first row is 390.7995
- Costs of goods sold for the first row is 372.19

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Gross income} = 390.7995 - 372.19 = 18.6095 \]

Thus, the missing value is 18.6095.

Formatted result:
the missing value is ##18.6095##
