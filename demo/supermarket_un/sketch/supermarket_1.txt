To find the missing value in the data, we need to look at the row with the missing 'Total' value:

Invoice ID: 541-08-3113
Product line: Food and beverages
Unit price: 65.97
Quantity: 8
Tax 5%: 26.388
Total: ?
Payment: Cash
Costs of goods sold: 527.76
Gross margin percentage: 4.8
Gross income: 25.33248

The formula to calculate 'Total' is:
\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5%} \]

Given:
Unit price = 65.97
Quantity = 8
Tax 5% = 26.388

\[ \text{Total} = (65.97 \times 8) + 26.388 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 527.76 + 26.388 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 554.148 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##554.148##.
