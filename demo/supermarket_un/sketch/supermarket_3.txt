To find the missing value in the 'Total' column for the row with Invoice ID '325-90-8763', we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = \text{Costs of goods sold} + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data provided:
- Costs of goods sold = 465.7
- Tax 5% = 23.285

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Total} = 465.7 + 23.285 = 488.985 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##488.985##.
