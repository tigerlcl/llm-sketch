To find the missing value in the data, we need to calculate the 'Total' for the row where it is missing. The 'Total' can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data, the missing 'Total' corresponds to the second row:

- Unit price = 46.22
- Quantity = 4
- Tax 5% = 9.244

Using the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = (46.22 \times 4) + 9.244 = 184.88 + 9.244 = 194.124 \]

Thus, the missing value is 194.124. Therefore, the formatted result is:

the missing value is ##194.124##
