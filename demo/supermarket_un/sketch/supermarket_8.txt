To find the missing value in the 'Gross income' column for the row with Invoice ID '142-63-6033', we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Gross income} = \text{Total} - \text{Costs of goods sold} \]

From the data:
- Total = 484.89
- Costs of goods sold = 461.8

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Gross income} = 484.89 - 461.8 = 23.09 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##23.09##.
