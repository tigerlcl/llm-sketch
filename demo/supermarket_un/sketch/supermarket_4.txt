To find the missing value in the "Gross income" column for the row with Invoice ID "593-08-5916", we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Gross income} = \text{Total} - \text{Costs of goods sold} \]

From the data:
- Total = 16.275
- Costs of goods sold = 15.5

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Gross income} = 16.275 - 15.5 = 0.775 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##0.775##.
