To find the missing value in the "Gross income" column, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Gross income} = \text{Total} - \text{Costs of goods sold} \]

From the data provided for the second row:
- Total = 232.155
- Costs of goods sold = 221.1

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Gross income} = 232.155 - 221.1 = 11.055 \]

Thus, the missing value is 11.055. 

Formatted result: the missing value is ##11.055##.
