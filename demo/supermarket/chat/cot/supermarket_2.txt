Let's think step by step about how to solve the problem of the missing value in the dataset. We know that the formula to calculate the 'Total' is:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data provided:
- Unit price = 77
- Quantity = 1
- Tax 5% = 3.85

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Total} = (77 \times 1) + 3.85 = 77 + 3.85 = 80.85 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##80.85##.
