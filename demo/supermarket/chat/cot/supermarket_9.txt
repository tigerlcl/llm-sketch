Let's think step by step about how to find the missing value in the data provided. We need to calculate the missing "Tax 5%" for the "Electronic accessories" product line.

1. **Understanding the Formula**: The tax is calculated as 5% of the product of the unit price and quantity. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Tax 5\%} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) \times 0.05
   \]

2. **Extracting Values for Calculation**:
   - Unit price for Electronic accessories = 99
   - Quantity = 1

3. **Performing the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Tax 5\%} = (99 \times 1) \times 0.05 = 99 \times 0.05 = 4.95
   \]

Thus, the missing value is 4.95. Therefore, the missing value is ##4.95##.
