Let's think step by step about how to find the missing value in the data provided. We are given columns for Product line, Unit price, Quantity, Tax 5%, Total, and Payment. The missing value is in the "Total" column for the "Sports and travel" product line.

To find the missing Total, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data:
- Unit price = 16
- Quantity = 10
- Tax 5% = 8.0

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Total} = (16 \times 10) + 8.0 = 160 + 8.0 = 168.0 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##168.0##.
