Let's think step by step about how to find the missing value in the dataset provided. The missing value is in the "Total" column for the "Home and lifestyle" product line where the unit price is 45 and the quantity is 4. 

First, we need to understand how the "Total" is calculated:
- Total = (Unit price * Quantity) + Tax 5%

Given:
- Unit price = 45
- Quantity = 4
- Tax 5% = 9.0

Now, calculate the Total:
- Total = (45 * 4) + 9.0 = 180 + 9.0 = 189.0

Thus, the missing value is ##189.0##.
