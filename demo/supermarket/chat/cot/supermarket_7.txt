Let's think step by step to find the missing value in the data:

1. **Understanding the Data**: The data contains columns for Product line, Unit price, Quantity, Tax 5%, Total, and Payment method. The missing value is in the "Tax 5%" column for the first row.

2. **Formula for Tax Calculation**: Tax is calculated as 5% of the product of the Unit price and Quantity. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Tax} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) \times 0.05
   \]

3. **Applying the Formula**:
   - For the first row, the Unit price is 95 and the Quantity is 7.
   - Calculate the product of Unit price and Quantity: \(95 \times 7 = 665\)
   - Calculate 5% of 665: \(665 \times 0.05 = 33.25\)

Therefore, the missing value for the Tax 5% in the first row is 33.25.

Presenting the answer in the required format: the missing value is ##33.25##.
