Let's think step by step to determine the missing value in the "Health and beauty" product line for the "Tax 5%" column. 

1. First, we need to understand the formula used to calculate the "Tax 5%" from the given data. The formula to calculate the tax is:
   \[ \text{Tax 5%} = \text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity} \times 0.05 \]

2. From the data, "Health and beauty" has a unit price of 97 and a quantity of 9. Plugging these values into the formula gives:
   \[ \text{Tax 5%} = 97 \times 9 \times 0.05 \]
   \[ \text{Tax 5%} = 43.65 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##43.65##.
