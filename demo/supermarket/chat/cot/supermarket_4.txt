Let's think step by step to determine the missing value in the data provided.

1. **Identify the Pattern**: We notice that the columns are "Product line," "Unit price," "Quantity," "Tax 5%," "Total," and "Payment." The missing value is in the "Total" column for the product line "Fashion accessories" with a unit price of 65 and a quantity of 1.

2. **Calculate the Total**: The formula to calculate "Total" would be:
   \[
   \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5%}
   \]
   Given that the unit price is 65 and the quantity is 1, the calculation for the subtotal (before tax) would be:
   \[
   65 \times 1 = 65
   \]
   The tax is already given as 3.25.

3. **Add the Tax to the Subtotal**: 
   \[
   65 + 3.25 = 68.25
   \]

Thus, the missing "Total" value is 68.25.

Presenting the answer as required: the missing value is ##68.25##.
