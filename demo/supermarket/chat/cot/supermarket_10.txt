Let's think step by step about how to find the missing value in the dataset provided. The missing value is in the "Total" column for the "Health and beauty" product line where the unit price is 71 and the quantity is 10.

First, we know that the "Total" is calculated by adding the "Tax 5%" to the product of "Unit price" and "Quantity". The formula to calculate the "Total" is:
\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5%} \]

Given:
- Unit price = 71
- Quantity = 10
- Tax 5% = 35.5

We can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Total} = (71 \times 10) + 35.5 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 710 + 35.5 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 745.5 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##745.5##.
