### Step 1: Issue Targeting
Upon examining the data, it is evident that there is a missing value in the "Tax 5%" column for the first entry.

### Step 2: Columns Filtering
To address this issue, we need to focus on the following columns:
- Unit price
- Quantity
- Tax 5%
- Total

These columns are interconnected as the tax is calculated based on the unit price and quantity, which then contributes to the total.

### Step 3: Entry Sampling
We will select a few entries without missing values to understand the relationship:
- Home and lifestyle, 24, 7, 8.4, 176.4, Ewallet
- Home and lifestyle, 94, 8, 37.6, 789.6, Ewallet
- Home and lifestyle, 49, 10, 24.5, 514.5, Credit card

### Step 4: Rule Mining
From the sampled entries, we observe the following calculation for the "Tax 5%":
\[ \text{Tax 5%} = (\text{Unit Price} \times \text{Quantity}) \times 0.05 \]

### Step 5: Rule Formulation
Using the observed rule, we can formulate a function to calculate the missing "Tax 5%" value:

```python
def calculate_tax(unit_price, quantity):
    return (unit_price * quantity) * 0.05
```

Now, we use this function to calculate the missing "Tax 5%" for the first entry:
- Unit price: 95
- Quantity: 7

```python
missing_tax = calculate_tax(95, 7)
print("Calculated Missing Tax 5%:", missing_tax)
```

This function and calculation will provide the missing "Tax 5%" value for the entry with the missing data.
