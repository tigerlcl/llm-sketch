### Issue Targeting
Upon reviewing the data, it's clear that there is a missing value in the "Tax 5%" column for the "Health and beauty" product line.

### Columns Filtering
To address this issue, we need to focus on the "Tax 5%", "Unit price", and "Quantity" columns. These columns are directly related and can help in calculating the missing value.

### Entry Sampling
We will sample a few entries from the dataset that do not have missing values in the "Tax 5%" column:

1. Sports and travel: Unit price = 39, Quantity = 1, Tax 5% = 1.95
2. Home and lifestyle: Unit price = 37, Quantity = 7, Tax 5% = 12.95
3. Food and beverages: Unit price = 16, Quantity = 6, Tax 5% = 4.8
4. Home and lifestyle: Unit price = 56, Quantity = 7, Tax 5% = 19.6

### Rule Mining
From the sampled entries, we observe that the "Tax 5%" value is calculated as 5% of the product of "Unit price" and "Quantity". The formula to calculate "Tax 5%" is:
\[ \text{Tax 5%} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) \times 0.05 \]

### Rule Formulation
We can now formulate this rule into a Python function to compute the missing "Tax 5%" value:

```python
def calculate_tax(unit_price, quantity):
    return (unit_price * quantity) * 0.05
```

### Impute Missing Value
Using the above function, we can calculate the missing "Tax 5%" for the "Health and beauty" product line:

```python
# Given values
unit_price = 97
quantity = 9

# Calculate missing Tax 5%
missing_tax = calculate_tax(unit_price, quantity)
print(f"The calculated Tax 5% for Health and beauty is: {missing_tax}")
```

This function and calculation will provide the missing "Tax 5%" value for the "Health and beauty" product line based on the observed rule from other entries.
