### Issue Targeting:
Upon reviewing the provided data, it's evident that there is a missing value in the "Tax 5%" column for the entry corresponding to "Electronic accessories".

### Columns Filtering:
To address the missing value, the relevant columns are "Unit price", "Quantity", "Tax 5%", and "Total". These columns are interconnected as they are used to calculate the sales tax and total amount.

### Entry Sampling:
Let's sample a few entries with no issues to understand the relationship:
1. Food and beverages: Unit price = 49, Quantity = 7, Tax 5% = 17.15, Total = 360.15
2. Sports and travel: Unit price = 52, Quantity = 10, Tax 5% = 26.0, Total = 546.0
3. Health and beauty: Unit price = 20, Quantity = 5, Tax 5% = 5.0, Total = 105.0

### Rule Mining:
From the sampled entries, the calculation for "Tax 5%" appears to be:
\[ \text{Tax 5%} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) \times 0.05 \]
This formula calculates 5% of the product of "Unit price" and "Quantity".

### Rule Formulation:
Using the identified rule, we can formulate a Python function to calculate the missing "Tax 5%" value:

```python
def calculate_tax(unit_price, quantity):
    return (unit_price * quantity) * 0.05

# Applying the function to the entry with the missing value
unit_price_missing = 99
quantity_missing = 1
tax_missing = calculate_tax(unit_price_missing, quantity_missing)

print(f"The calculated missing 'Tax 5%' value is: {tax_missing}")
```

This function and calculation will correctly impute the missing value in the "Tax 5%" column for the "Electronic accessories" entry.
