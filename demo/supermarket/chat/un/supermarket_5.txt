To find the missing value in the "Tax 5%" column for the "Health and beauty" product line, we need to calculate it based on the given formula:

\[ \text{Tax 5%} = \text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity} \times 0.05 \]

For the "Health and beauty" product line:
- Unit price = 81
- Quantity = 7

\[ \text{Tax 5%} = 81 \times 7 \times 0.05 = 28.35 \]

Therefore, the missing value is 28.35.

Presenting the answer as required:
