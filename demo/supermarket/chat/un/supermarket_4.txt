To find the missing value in the data, we need to calculate the "Total" for the row where it is missing. The formula to calculate "Total" is:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data provided:
- Unit price = 65
- Quantity = 1
- Tax 5% = 3.25

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Total} = (65 \times 1) + 3.25 = 65 + 3.25 = 68.25 \]

Thus, the missing value is 68.25.

Formatted answer:
the missing value is ##68.25##
