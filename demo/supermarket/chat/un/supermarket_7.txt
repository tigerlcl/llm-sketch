To find the missing value for the "Tax 5%" in the first row, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Tax 5%} = \text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity} \times 0.05 \]

Given the "Unit price" is 95 and the "Quantity" is 7, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Tax 5%} = 95 \times 7 \times 0.05 = 33.25 \]

Thus, the missing value is 33.25. 

Presenting the answer as requested:

the missing value is ##33.25##
