To find the missing value in the provided data, we need to calculate the missing Tax 5% for the product line "Health and beauty" where the Unit price is 70 and Quantity is 5.

The formula to calculate Tax 5% is:
\[ \text{Tax 5%} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) \times 0.05 \]

Given:
- Unit price = 70
- Quantity = 5

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Tax 5%} = (70 \times 5) \times 0.05 = 350 \times 0.05 = 17.5 \]

Therefore, the missing value is 17.5. 

Formatted result:
the missing value is ##17.5##
