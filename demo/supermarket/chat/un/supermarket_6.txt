To find the missing value in the "Total" column for the "Sports and travel" product line, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

Given:
- Unit price = 16
- Quantity = 10
- Tax 5% = 8.0

Calculating the total:
\[ \text{Total} = (16 \times 10) + 8.0 = 160 + 8.0 = 168.0 \]

Thus, the missing value is ##168.0##.
