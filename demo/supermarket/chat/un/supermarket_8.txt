To find the missing value in the dataset, we need to calculate the "Total" for the row where it's missing. The formula for "Total" is given by:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data:

- Unit price = 45
- Quantity = 4
- Tax 5% = 9.0

Using the formula:

\[ \text{Total} = (45 \times 4) + 9.0 = 180 + 9.0 = 189.0 \]

Therefore, the missing value is 189.0.
