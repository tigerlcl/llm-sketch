To find the missing value in the data, we need to calculate the "Total" for the first row where it is missing. The formula to calculate the "Total" is:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity}) + \text{Tax 5\%} \]

From the data provided for the first row:
- Unit price = 77
- Quantity = 1
- Tax 5% = 3.85

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Total} = (77 \times 1) + 3.85 = 77 + 3.85 = 80.85 \]

Thus, the missing value is 80.85. Therefore, the answer is:
the missing value is ##80.85##.
