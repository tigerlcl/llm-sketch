To find the missing value in the dataset provided, we need to calculate the missing "Tax 5%" for the "Electronic accessories" product line. The formula to calculate "Tax 5%" is:

\[ \text{Tax 5%} = \text{Unit price} \times \text{Quantity} \times 0.05 \]

For the "Electronic accessories" product line:
- Unit price = 99
- Quantity = 1

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Tax 5%} = 99 \times 1 \times 0.05 = 4.95 \]

Therefore, the missing value is 4.95. 

Formatted as requested:
the missing value is ##4.95##
