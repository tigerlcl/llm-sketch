### Related Columns
The columns related to the issue of missing values in the 'Total_Stops' column are primarily the 'Route' and 'Duration' columns, as these directly relate to the number of stops a flight makes. Here are the relevant columns:

```python
['Route', 'Duration', 'Total_Stops']
```

### Tuple Sampling
To provide a sample of records without issues in the 'Total_Stops' column, I will randomly select a few entries from the provided data:

```python
[
    ('BLR → BOM → DEL', '15h 50m', '1 stop'),
    ('DEL → HYD → MAA → COK', '20h 10m', '2 stops'),
    ('CCU → BOM → BLR', '11h 45m', '1 stop'),
    ('MAA → CCU', '2h 15m', 'non-stop'),
    ('DEL → BOM → COK', '11h', '1 stop')
]
```

### Rule Mining
Based on the sampled data, we can infer a rule to estimate the 'Total_Stops' from the 'Route' and 'Duration'. Here's a simple rule based on the number of arrows (→) in the 'Route', which typically indicates the number of legs in the journey minus one (which corresponds to the number of stops):

```python
def estimate_stops(route):
    # Count the number of segments in the route
    segments = route.count('→')
    if segments == 0:
        return 'non-stop'
    elif segments == 1:
        return '1 stop'
    else:
        return f'{segments} stops'
```

This function can be used to fill in missing 'Total_Stops' values based on the 'Route' information.
