### Related Columns
The related columns to address the missing value in the 'Route' column are:
```python
['Source', 'Destination', 'Route', 'Total_Stops']
```

### Tuple Sampling
Randomly selected no-issue records based on the related columns:
```python
[('Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BOM → COK', '1 stop'),
 ('Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → HYD → COK', '1 stop')]
```

### Rule Mining
The rule to infer the missing 'Route' based on 'Source', 'Destination', and 'Total_Stops':
```python
if source == 'Delhi' and destination == 'Cochin' and total_stops == '1 stop':
    route = 'DEL → BOM → COK'  # Most common route for this configuration
```
This rule is derived from the observation that flights from Delhi to Cochin with one stop commonly stop at Bombay (BOM).
