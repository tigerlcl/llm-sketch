To find the missing value in the data, we need to calculate the duration for the flight from Kolkata to Banglore for Air India on 24/03/2019. The departure time is 09:25, and the arrival time is 05:35 on the next day (25 Mar).

To calculate the duration:
1. Convert the departure and arrival times into datetime objects, accounting for the change in date.
2. Subtract the departure time from the arrival time to get the duration.

Departure: 24/03/2019 at 09:25
Arrival: 25/03/2019 at 05:35

Duration = Arrival Time - Departure Time
         = 05:35 (25 Mar) - 09:25 (24 Mar)
         = 20 hours and 10 minutes

Thus, the missing value is 20h 10m.

Therefore, the formatted result is: the missing value is ##20h 10m##.
