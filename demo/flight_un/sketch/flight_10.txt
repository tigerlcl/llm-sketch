To determine the missing value in the dataset, we need to identify the column with the '?' character. From the provided data, we can see that the '?' appears in the 'Dep_Time' column for the first row:

Jet Airways,18/05/2019,Delhi,Cochin,DEL → AMD → BOM → COK,?,12:35 19 May,13h 30m,2 stops

To find the missing 'Dep_Time', we can use the given 'Arrival_Time' and 'Duration' to estimate it. The 'Arrival_Time' is '12:35 19 May' and the 'Duration' is '13h 30m'. By subtracting the duration from the arrival time, we can estimate the departure time.

Calculating backwards:
- Arrival Time: 12:35 on 19 May
- Duration: 13 hours and 30 minutes

Subtracting 13 hours and 30 minutes from 12:35 on 19 May, we get approximately 23:05 on 18 May.

Thus, the missing value is ##23:05##.
