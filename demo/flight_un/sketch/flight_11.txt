To determine the missing value in the "Duration" column for the SpiceJet flight on 9/04/2019 from Delhi to Cochin, we can calculate the time difference between the "Dep_Time" and "Arrival_Time".

For the SpiceJet flight:
- Departure Time (Dep_Time): 06:05
- Arrival Time (Arrival_Time): 11:20

To calculate the duration:
- Convert both times into minutes past midnight:
  - Dep_Time: \(6 \times 60 + 5 = 365\) minutes
  - Arrival_Time: \(11 \times 60 + 20 = 680\) minutes
- Duration in minutes: \(680 - 365 = 315\) minutes

Convert the duration back to hours and minutes:
- Hours: \(315 \div 60 = 5\) hours
- Minutes: \(315 \mod 60 = 15\) minutes

Thus, the duration is "5h 15m".

Therefore, the missing value is ##5h 15m##.
