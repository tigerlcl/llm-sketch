To determine the missing value in the data, we need to look at the row where the duration is denoted by a '?'. The row in question is:

Multiple carriers Premium economy,21/03/2019,Delhi,Cochin,DEL → BOM → COK,06:00,12:35,?,1 stop

To calculate the missing duration, we need to consider the departure time and the arrival time:

- Departure Time: 06:00
- Arrival Time: 12:35

The duration is the difference between the arrival time and the departure time. Calculating this:

From 06:00 to 12:35 is 6 hours and 35 minutes.

Thus, the missing value is 6h 35m.

Therefore, the formatted result is: the missing value is ##6h 35m##.
