In the provided data, the missing value denoted by '?' is in the 'Total_Stops' column for the Jet Airways flight from Banglore to New Delhi. To determine the correct value for this missing entry, we can look at other entries with similar routes.

From the data:
- Jet Airways, 12/03/2019, Banglore, New Delhi, BLR → BOM → DEL, 07:00, 23:00, 16h, ?
- Jet Airways, 01/03/2019, Banglore, New Delhi, BLR → BOM → DEL, 14:05, 10:25 02 Mar, 20h 20m, 1 stop

Both flights have the same route (BLR → BOM → DEL). The second entry indicates that this route has '1 stop'. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the missing value for the first entry should also be '1 stop'.

Thus, the missing value is ##1 stop##.
