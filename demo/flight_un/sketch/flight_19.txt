To find the missing value in the "Duration" column for the first row, we need to calculate the time difference between "Dep_Time" and "Arrival_Time".

For the first row:
- Dep_Time: 07:30
- Arrival_Time: 19:00

Duration = Arrival_Time - Dep_Time
          = 19:00 - 07:30
          = 11 hours and 30 minutes

Thus, the missing value is 11h 30m.

Formatted answer: the missing value is ##11h 30m##.
