### Step 1: Locate the Problematic and Related Columns

From the provided data, it's clear that the column with missing values (denoted by '?') is the `Route` column. To fix the missing value in the `Route` column, we can use related columns such as `Source` and `Destination` which provide information about the start and end points of the journey.

**Problematic and Related Columns:**
```python
columns = ['Source', 'Destination', 'Route']
```

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

To understand the relationship between `Source`, `Destination`, and `Route`, we will sample some records that do not have missing values in the `Route` column.

**Sampled Records:**
```python
sampled_records = [
    ('Mumbai', 'Hyderabad', 'BOM → HYD'),
    ('Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BLR → COK'),
    ('Kolkata', 'Banglore', 'CCU → BOM → BLR'),
    ('Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → HYD → COK'),
    ('Kolkata', 'Banglore', 'CCU → DEL → BLR')
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

From the sampled records, we can derive a rule that describes the relationship between `Source`, `Destination`, and `Route`. This rule can be used to predict or fill in missing `Route` values based on `Source` and `Destination`.

**Python Code for Rule Mining:**
```python
def predict_route(source, destination):
    route_rules = {
        ('Mumbai', 'Hyderabad'): 'BOM → HYD',
        ('Delhi', 'Cochin'): 'DEL → BLR → COK',
        ('Kolkata', 'Banglore'): 'CCU → BOM → BLR',
        ('Delhi', 'Cochin'): 'DEL → HYD → COK',
        ('Kolkata', 'Banglore'): 'CCU → DEL → BLR'
    }
    return route_rules.get((source, destination), "Route Unknown")

# Example usage:
missing_route = predict_route('Mumbai', 'Hyderabad')
print("Predicted Route:", missing_route)
```

This function `predict_route` uses a dictionary to map pairs of `Source` and `Destination` to their corresponding `Route`. If a pair is not found in the dictionary, it returns "Route Unknown". This can be expanded or refined with more data or different logic as needed.
