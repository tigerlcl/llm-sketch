### Step 1: Identify Problematic and Related Columns

From the provided data, it's clear that the column with missing values (denoted by '?') is the `Route` column. To fix the missing value in the `Route` column, we can use related columns that might influence or determine the route. These columns include `Source`, `Destination`, and `Total_Stops`.

**Problematic and Related Columns:**
```python
['Route', 'Source', 'Destination', 'Total_Stops']
```

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

To understand the relationship between the `Route`, `Source`, `Destination`, and `Total_Stops`, we will sample some records that do not have missing values in the `Route` column.

**Sampled Records:**
```python
[
    ('CCU → HYD → BLR', 'Kolkata', 'Banglore', '1 stop'),
    ('BOM → HYD', 'Mumbai', 'Hyderabad', 'non-stop'),
    ('DEL → BOM → COK', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', '1 stop'),
    ('CCU → BLR', 'Kolkata', 'Banglore', 'non-stop'),
    ('CCU → DEL → BLR', 'Kolkata', 'Banglore', '1 stop')
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

From the sampled records, we can observe a pattern or rule that can help us deduce the missing `Route` value. The rule can be described as follows:

- If `Total_Stops` is 'non-stop', the `Route` is directly from `Source` to `Destination`.
- If `Total_Stops` is '1 stop', there is usually an intermediate major city or hub involved.

**Python Code to Describe the Rule:**
```python
def infer_route(source, destination, total_stops):
    if total_stops == 'non-stop':
        return f"{source[:3]} → {destination[:3]}"
    elif total_stops == '1 stop':
        # Assuming a major city or hub based on common patterns
        if source == 'Kolkata' and destination == 'Banglore':
            return "CCU → DEL → BLR"  # Example: Delhi as a common hub
        elif source == 'Delhi' and destination == 'Cochin':
            return "DEL → BOM → COK"  # Example: Mumbai as a common hub
        # Add more conditions based on further data analysis
    return None

# Example usage:
missing_route = infer_route('Kolkata', 'Banglore', '1 stop')
print(missing_route)  # Output should be "CCU → DEL → BLR"
```

This function `infer_route` uses the observed rules to predict the missing `Route` based on `Source`, `Destination`, and `Total_Stops`. More conditions can be added as more data is analyzed or available.
