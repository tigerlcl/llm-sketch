### Related Columns
The columns related to the issue of missing 'Duration' value are:
- `Dep_Time`: Departure time of the flight.
- `Arrival_Time`: Arrival time of the flight.
- `Duration`: Total duration of the flight (which is missing in one record).

These columns are directly related as the duration can be calculated from the difference between the departure and arrival times. Here they are in an array:

```python
['Dep_Time', 'Arrival_Time', 'Duration']
```

### Tuple Sampling
To understand the relationship and possibly derive a rule, we can sample some records that do not have missing 'Duration'. Here are a few samples:

```python
[
    ('16:45', '07:10 07 Jun', '14h 25m'),
    ('08:25', '19:50', '11h 25m'),
    ('20:35', '11:25 02 Mar', '14h 50m'),
    ('20:25', '01:30 10 May', '5h 5m'),
    ('14:35', '04:25 16 Jun', '13h 50m')
]
```

### Rule Mining
To calculate the `Duration` from `Dep_Time` and `Arrival_Time`, we can use Python's datetime library to handle the time calculations, considering potential overnight flights. Here's a Python function that demonstrates this:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def calculate_duration(dep_time, arrival_time):
    # Format strings for datetime parsing
    time_format = "%H:%M"
    datetime_format = "%H:%M %d %b"
    
    # Parse the departure time
    dep_datetime = datetime.strptime(dep_time, time_format)
    
    # Check if arrival time contains date (indicating next day or later)
    if ' ' in arrival_time:
        arr_datetime = datetime.strptime(arrival_time, datetime_format)
    else:
        arr_datetime = datetime.strptime(arrival_time, time_format)
        # If arrival time is earlier in the day, assume it's the next day
        if arr_datetime < dep_datetime:
            arr_datetime += timedelta(days=1)
    
    # Calculate duration
    duration = arr_datetime - dep_datetime
    hours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)
    minutes = remainder // 60
    
    # Format duration string
    duration_str = f"{hours}h {minutes}m"
    return duration_str

# Example usage:
dep_time = '07:30'
arrival_time = '19:00'
duration = calculate_duration(dep_time, arrival_time)
print(f"Calculated Duration: {duration}")
```

This function handles both same-day and next-day arrivals, which is crucial for accurately calculating flight durations that span midnight.
