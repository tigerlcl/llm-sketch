### Step 1: Related Columns Identification

From the provided data, the missing value is found in the `Total_Stops` column for the airline IndiGo traveling from Banglore to Delhi. To fix this issue, we can use the `Route` column which describes the journey path and can help determine the number of stops.

**Related Columns**: `['Route', 'Total_Stops']`

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

To understand the relationship between `Route` and `Total_Stops`, we will sample some records that do not have missing values in the `Total_Stops` column.

**Sampled Data**:
```python
[
    ("CCU → BLR", "non-stop"),
    ("DEL → BOM → COK", "1 stop"),
    ("DEL → MAA → COK", "1 stop"),
    ("DEL → BOM → COK", "1 stop")
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

From the sampled data, we can observe a pattern that the number of stops is directly related to the number of intermediate airports in the `Route`. Here's a Python function to determine the number of stops based on the route:

```python
def determine_stops(route):
    # Split the route by '→' to find the number of segments
    segments = route.split(" → ")
    # The number of stops is one less than the number of segments
    num_stops = len(segments) - 1
    # Return the appropriate string based on the number of stops
    if num_stops == 0:
        return "non-stop"
    elif num_stops == 1:
        return "1 stop"
    else:
        return f"{num_stops} stops"

# Example usage:
route_example = "BLR → DEL"
print(determine_stops(route_example))  # Output should be "non-stop" for the given problematic record
```

This function can be used to fill in the missing values in the `Total_Stops` column based on the `Route` information.
