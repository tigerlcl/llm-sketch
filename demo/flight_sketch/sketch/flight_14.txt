### Step 1: Locate the Problematic and Related Columns

From the provided data, it's clear that the column with missing values (denoted by '?') is `Dep_Time`. To address this issue, we need to consider columns that can help us infer the missing `Dep_Time`. The related columns would likely be `Route`, `Arrival_Time`, and `Duration` as these can help estimate the departure time based on the route duration and arrival time.

**Problematic and Related Columns Array:**
```python
['Route', 'Dep_Time', 'Arrival_Time', 'Duration']
```

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

We will randomly select several records that do not have issues (i.e., records where `Dep_Time` is not missing) focusing on the columns identified above. This will help us understand the typical relationship between these columns.

**Sampled Records Array of Tuples:**
```python
[
    ('BLR → DEL', '09:30', '12:20', '2h 50m'),
    ('CCU → DEL → BLR', '17:00', '23:25', '6h 25m'),
    ('BLR → BOM → DEL', '05:45', '11:25', '5h 40m'),
    ('CCU → BLR', '10:20', '12:55', '2h 35m'),
    ('BLR → BOM → BHO → DEL', '06:45', '09:25 13 Mar', '26h 40m')
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

To derive a rule for estimating `Dep_Time`, we can use the relationship between `Arrival_Time`, `Duration`, and `Route`. Here's a Python function that could estimate `Dep_Time` based on these relationships:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_time(time_str):
    """ Helper function to parse time in hh:mm format possibly with date """
    return datetime.strptime(time_str.split()[0], '%H:%M')

def estimate_dep_time(arrival_time, duration):
    """ Estimate departure time based on arrival time and duration """
    arrival_dt = parse_time(arrival_time)
    duration_parts = duration.split('h ')
    hours = int(duration_parts[0])
    minutes = int(duration_parts[1].replace('m', '')) if len(duration_parts) > 1 else 0
    duration_td = timedelta(hours=hours, minutes=minutes)
    estimated_dep_time = arrival_dt - duration_td
    return estimated_dep_time.strftime('%H:%M')

# Example usage:
arrival_time = '19:45'
duration = '2h 45m'
estimated_dep_time = estimate_dep_time(arrival_time, duration)
print(f"Estimated Departure Time: {estimated_dep_time}")
```

This function calculates the departure time by subtracting the duration from the arrival time. It assumes that the times are on the same day, which is a limitation in cases where the flight might span multiple days. Further refinement would be needed to handle such cases accurately.
