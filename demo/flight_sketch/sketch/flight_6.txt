### Step 1: Locate the Problematic and Related Columns

From the provided data, the column with missing values (denoted by '?') is `Dep_Time`. The related columns that can help fix this issue are likely to be `Source`, `Destination`, `Route`, `Arrival_Time`, `Duration`, and `Total_Stops` as these columns provide information about the flight's journey which can be used to infer the missing departure times.

**Problematic and Related Columns Array:**
```python
['Dep_Time', 'Source', 'Destination', 'Route', 'Arrival_Time', 'Duration', 'Total_Stops']
```

### Step 2: Tuple Sampling

To sample no-issue records (records without missing values), we will select a few records that have complete data in the `Dep_Time` column and are related to the problematic record's route or similar routes.

**Sampled Records Array of Tuple:**
```python
[
    ('12:50', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BOM → COK', '21:00', '8h 10m', '1 stop'),
    ('07:05', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BOM → COK', '12:35', '5h 30m', '1 stop'),
    ('07:55', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → BLR → COK', '22:30', '14h 35m', '1 stop'),
    ('09:45', 'Delhi', 'Cochin', 'DEL → MAA → COK', '09:25 10 Jun', '23h 40m', '1 stop')
]
```

### Step 3: Rule Mining

To infer the missing `Dep_Time` for the record with the route `CCU → BOM → BLR`, we can analyze the relationship between `Route`, `Arrival_Time`, `Duration`, and `Dep_Time` from the sampled results. Here's a Python code block that describes a potential rule:

```python
def infer_departure_time(route, arrival_time, duration, total_stops):
    # Convert arrival_time and duration into datetime and timedelta objects
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    fmt = "%H:%M"
    if ' ' in arrival_time:
        arrival_time = arrival_time.split(' ')[0]  # Consider only the time part for simplicity
    arrival_dt = datetime.strptime(arrival_time, fmt)
    
    # Convert duration to timedelta
    hours, minutes = map(int, duration.split('h '))
    minutes = int(minutes.replace('m', ''))
    duration_td = timedelta(hours=hours, minutes=minutes)
    
    # Calculate departure time by subtracting duration from arrival time
    departure_dt = arrival_dt - duration_td
    
    # Format departure time back to string
    departure_time = departure_dt.strftime(fmt)
    
    return departure_time

# Example usage:
route = 'CCU → BOM → BLR'
arrival_time = '08:15'
duration = '18h 10m'
total_stops = '1 stop'
dep_time = infer_departure_time(route, arrival_time, duration, total_stops)
print(f"Inferred Departure Time: {dep_time}")
```

This rule assumes that the departure time can be calculated by subtracting the flight duration from the arrival time, which is a common approach when exact schedules are not known. Adjustments may be needed based on timezone differences or overnight flights.
